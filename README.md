# About
A Prompt Engineer and Applied Generative AI Practitioner with a strong foundation in Computer Science, passionate about designing effective prompts, understanding LLM behavior, and improving human–AI interactions through experimentation and research.

Hello There!👋🏻 
**Nandish** here!

I hold a **Bachelor of Computer Applications** degree from **Bengaluru City University**. I believe in the ability to _adapt_, _learn continuously_, and _apply knowledge practically across evolving technology domains_. My goal is to contribute meaningful value by building _reliable_, _accurate_, and _user-aligned AI systems_.

I am deeply committed to **Prompt Engineering, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a strong interest in applying _AI research concepts_ to _real-world_ use cases. I actively experiment with _prompts, reasoning techniques, and AI workflows_ to enhance _model accuracy, contextual understanding, and decision-making quality_.

I believe that effective AI systems are built not just on models, but on clear instructions, thoughtful design, and continuous evaluation.

You may notice that I value depth of understanding over surface-level exposure. I strongly believe that real expertise comes from hands-on experimentation, critical thinking, and continuous refinement, especially when working with AI systems.

**Congratulations on making it this far!** Thank you for taking the time to read up to this point! :) ❤️

I have my CV ready. If you feel my profile aligns with your needs, feel free to reach out via **Email** or **LinkedIn**.
